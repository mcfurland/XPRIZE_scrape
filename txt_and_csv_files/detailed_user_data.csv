I spent a year in Scottsdale, AZ and promptly discovered the desert is not for me, and with the current climate, we're losing the beautiful trees that substantiate the PNW landscape.  I have been pondering how to save the planet for years and am stoked to share a plan that's been floating around my head for years. Low cost, simple and uses the very plant that cooled our planet 49 mil years ago.  Fortunately for us- this plant still exists!!",http://mistifelts,,,,Vancouver,[],[],[],[]

He approaches research with a “chemical perspective” of oceanography in which the distributions of chemical concentrations and isotope ratios are used to understand biogeochemical processes and the role of the ocean in the global fluxes of oxygen, carbon and nitrogen.
