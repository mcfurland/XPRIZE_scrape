TWREEC History 
Amongst the international climate research and consulting organizations ’’Third World Resources, Energy and Environment Center-TWREEC’’ is perhaps the first one established by Rashid Ahmed – an international hydrocarbon-hydrological engineer of Pakistan during the year 1990 motivated by that time unrealized looming concern that two vital natural resources (HC and HYDRO) of the earth planet are at head on collision course in socioeconomic service to humanity. Others like; ‘’Green Cross International’’ in Europe established by ex-USSR President Mikhail Gorbachev, ‘’Climate Reality’’, ‘’Water Keeper’’, and ‘’ICE911 now Polar Ice’’ established by ex. USA Vice President Al Gore, Senator R.F. Kennedy, 2 and MIT-UC Berkeley lady electrochemical engineer Dr. Leslie Field, respectively, entered the anti-global warming struggle years later than TWREEC – Sialkot, Pakistan. Mission of these esteemed organizations corresponds to green economy transition, air pollution control, water resources protection, and prevention of continental/polar climate ice melt. European and American research organization quickly attained powerful world status of ‘Climate Campaigners’ as their updates sent to TWREEC regularly indicate. Paradoxically, TWREEC, comprehending the same full range CCM & CCA functions for developing countries and exceptional R&D for the entire world continues pondering about sustenance but somehow continuing its projects for 17SDG2030 UN Agenda of Paris Climate Accord 2015 through meager resources of the founder director.

We have designed a system in which the carbon waste is oxidised at high pressures and temperatures (in Super Critical H2O) within a contained reactor. The energy produced in the form of heat is extracted to generate commercial electricity production while the waste products are repurposed for a variety of applications. As the temperature in the reaction is controlled to remain below the melting point of the minerals contained in the “ash” component, these minerals can be recovered from the process as a harmless by-product such as demineralised water and minerals that can be harvested and used for agricultural, chemical and high-end technological production usage.  

During the air separation process, the 79% of nitrogen found in the air can be used for the production of ammonia. This ammonia can be combined with CO2 to produce urea, an important agricultural source of nitrogen, the residue of the ammonia is also available as a source of hydrogen for fuel cells. The production potential is a zero-carbon to atmosphere emission.

The above description may seem simplistic but every step has its specialised area of research. I would like to plug into existing technology and research where possible. We have committed a large part of our lives to this project without any government or large institutional funding. We are convinced of the potential of our proposal to change the way man currently impacts the world.

The Best way to Capture Carbon and improve quality of life for farming communities.

Introduction 

As ""the best part is no part""
and ""the best process is no process"",
so the best technology is no technology.

The natural process of Photosynthesis is best

However we do need the Technologies of 
Solar City, Tesla, Spacex, Starlink and The Boring Company, to support the natural process of Photosynthesis.

We should apply ""First Principles Thinking"" to the Science of Carbon Capture.

Some Detail

For countless thousands of years, nature has provided the best method. It's obvious that Photosynthesis is the easiest and safest method of Carbon Capture.

""Scientific First Principals"", points to Ruminants Grassing Perennial Grasses, as the most efficient Photosynthetic ""machinary""
to Sequester Carbon.

A given area of land growing Perennial grasses,  grassed by Ruminants, performs much greater Carbon Sequestration than the same area growing trees.

Of course we do need Trees as well, 
in fact we need the Full Diversity of all living things to make a Balanced environment.

In very simple terms, as known, Photosynthesis with Perennial grasses, captures carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and puts the carbon into roots and leaves of the grasses.

When Ruminants prune the perennial grasses, the roots ""drop off"" in the same proportion as the above ground pruning, so those dropped roots, which contain carbon, are already in the ground, adding to the soil biomass. The ruminant livestock adds much more carbon to the soil by means of manure and urine.

Ruminant Livestock and Poultry are used to increase the efficiency of the Soil Building process by means of Manure and Urine increaseing soil fertility and further add to soil health.

Not all the grass is eaten. Some is converted to mulch, mixed with the manure, by being trampled by livestock hooves, so no bare ground is exposed to the hot sun and wind after grassing.

The natural rainfall water will stay in the soil.
So the better the soil gets, the need for irrigation is much reduced.

So in summary, nature has been going this for countless thousands of years.
Due to unfathomable complexity, humans have caused desertification, slowing down the natural processes of Soil Maintenance. 
So Soils have degraded and eroded away.
Now unable to sustain plants the ground is bare.

How it works 

Until recently, we have not known how to effectively manage the complex natural processes of soil building with perennial grasses, ruminants and poultry.

The answer is Holistic Management of
everything that effects the complex processes.

Farming Families, Environment, Technology, Land, Livestock, Poultry, Politics, Finance to name some.

Holistic Management makes use of feedback by means of monitoring outcomes in all related matters.

So management of the grass is done by monitoring all matters that effect grass conditions.
Ruminant Livestock intensively grassing the perennial grasses in densely packed hurds for a day at a time.
The hurd is moved to fresh grass, later in the afternoon, each day.
The number of cows in the hurd and the timing, are functions of soil quality, grass quality, amount of recent rainfall and season etc.

Method Example
In times of favorable conditions,
we might have 100 acres of land and 400 cows.
What we do is, put ALL the 400 cows, on ONE ACRE at a time for ONE DAY.
So all 100 acres are grassed in 100 days,
but at the rate of one acre per day.
This means that 99 acres are resting and recovering for 99 days. There's 99 acres of Photosynthesis for 99 days. That grows a lot of grass, capturing many thousands of tones of carbon each year.

Chickens are following the cows. 
A couple of days after the cows move from an acre, 3000 free range chickens, scratch through the cow pat's eating the insects and vegetation.

In less favourable conditions, 
less cows and chickens are used, or the time on each acre, might be decreased to from 1 day to 6 hours.

That was only one hundred acres. Imagine the Trillions of Tones of Sequestered Carbon if this was done at very large scale.

Why Families?
Farming Communities include all family members. This style of farming requires a lot of people to be involved. That's a good thing, we need to encongare lots of people to get involved in farming and supplying food.

Why Ruminant Livestock?
The animals Rumen organ supports microorganisms that help in the digestion of the grasses, these find there way into the soil, via the manure, adding to life support in the environment.
So there is no need of chemical fertilisers, which reduces costs.

Using Ruminant Livestock is the most efficient way to break down the grass to create the best soil.

A high percentage of Soil is Carbon.


Why Poultry?
The Poultry provide sanitation, devouring the insects that are attracted by the Manure & Urine and Ending the Lifecycle of livestock Parasites.
We also need to encourage all bird species to join the Poultry in this maintenance.
Of cause the Poultry would need protection from the likes of hawks and eagles, they are also needed in the environment.

So there is no need of pharmaceuticals for livestock or poultry which reduces costs.

Why Technology 
We do need modern technology to get this process, kickstarted in deserts.

There's Billions of hectares of deserts on earth that should be perennial grass Prairies.

But we need Freshwater for Humans,  Ruminants, Poultry and all other living things in these prairies.
Using solar panels to power desalination plants, would kickstart this process in deserts. Once kickstarted it would become self sustaining due to the great amount rainwater that would get stored in the good deep soil it would create.

There are many advantages to using perennial grasses with ruminant livestock and poultry to sequester carbon.
It would provide food in the form of meat, eggs and milk, healthy lifestyle, NO POLLUTION, less desert, more freshwater.
The fertile soil would also grow vegetables.
All this without pharmaceuticals nor chemicals.

Even if we are vegetarian or vegan, we still need Ruminants and Poultry grassing perennial grasses to Capture Carbon, reduce Deserts and restore natural freshwater in the environment.

""Another reason to get up in the morning"".
To be involved in a venture like this would be as stimulating as the quest for a
Space Faring Civilisation going multi-planetary by populating Mars.

Tesla Technologies would be a great help.

Solar City Panels, Power Pack, Power Wall, Cybretruck and Semi would be put to great use.

The cost of getting fossil fuel into deserts to provide energy and transportation, would destroy the economy of such a venture.

Tesla has solved that problem.

Spacex Technology 
Satellites would help farmers monitor farms.
(A feedback method for Holistic Management)

Starlink would also be a great help in remote communities for communications, monitoring, remote learning and entertainment for farmers and their families.

Capture Carbon and create large markets for all you companies and improve the lifestyle of billions of people.

In fact Tesla Farms could be a thing

or Tesla Agriculture : Tesla Ag could be a thing 

Tesla Ag would supply ""Carbon Farmers"" with all the Support Technology required.
Energy Systems, Transport Systems, Aircon and the most important technology Solar Powered Freshwater Desalination Systems.

Other Technologies Tesla Ag could provide: .
Solar Electric Fencing.
Robotic self moving electric fence system.
Large mobile shelters for livestock and poultry.
Robotic milking machines
Portable abattoir systems with refrigeration.

One bad habit humans have is we tend to concentrate pollutants into confined spaces.

Agricultural industries generally pollute badly.
Decentralised Agriculture would solve this.
Portable Agricultural Infrastructure is the way to go.

Feed lots are an example of bad management.
With feed lots they take the cows off the land
and concentrate Manure and Urine into a very small area, then they are shaveling it forever 


The Dairy Industry is equally stupid 
Bring the cows indoors concentrating manure and urine into a small space and having to shovel it again forever.

The Abattoir Industry is most stupid.
Bring all the cows to a central toxic environment by concentrating all the blood, guts, manure and urine into one toxic place.

Portable Abattoirs are much better 
Slaughter cows in the paddock and bury the blood and guts in a different place immediately every time.
This adds to soil fertility and is not toxic.

The best idea is leave the cows out on the grass
the manure and urine falls where it should.

Automatic Portable milking robots are much better. (see https://www.lely.com) The cows decided when they get milked. Farmers can have a life.

A Solar powered Milking Robot would Automatically follow the cows, moving once a day. The robot would include an automated pressure washer to clean manure and urine off it's weigh bridge floor and the cows, before the next cow is allowed in. That way there would be no build up of manure and urine on the equipment. This would keep the cows healthy and eliminate the stench.
Yes the milking robot has a weigh bridge to monitor each cows weight to provide feedback about the cows condition. The milk is also analysed to monitor individual cow health. The cows wear a collar including rfid system to identify each individual.

Non milking hurd members would be enticed, by means of food treats, onto a weigh bridge for health monitoring.
Or when each beast wants a drink of water it approaches a gate which reads the collar id, let's the beast into the drinking booth which is over a weigh bridge, as the beast drinks it's weight, temperature, hooves are inspected and quantity of water drunk is all logged in a database.
All this monitoring aids in the
Holistic Management of the hurd.

If the hooves need attention, such as trimming, details are stored in the database, so at some time soon after, when the beast leaves the drinking booth, it is sent to a veterinary booth where a vet can take appropriate action. This way beasts can be isolated from the hurd in a stress free manor.

The Musk Foundation could provide very low interest loans to help ""Carbon Farmers"" get started.

     1.  Ever growing production of human landfill waste.
     2.  Ever increasing CO2 concentrations in Earths atmosphere.
     3.  Increasing metal toxicity in ground water.
History and Motivation
This project started over five years ago with the intention to reduce the ever-growing landfills by converting the waste material deposited into reusable fuel.    As research and development progressed other benefits, such as being a carbon negative process, started to become more apparent.  This technology, if funded, will not only produce renewable energy but also will remove greenhouse gases and clean up the ecosystem by putting carbon back where it belongs, into the soil from which it was originally removed.
Most people believe that feeding our people is our greatest problem.  The laws of thermodynamics provide additional insight, however.  Any closed system, such as our world, has a maximum entropy that defines its “heat death.”  As we waste our energy and bury our valuable resources in disordered landfills, we speed our way to this unhealthy thermodynamic limit.  Our modified crops, fertilizers, insecticides, irrigation, etc. make feeding ourselves economically feasible.  It is far more difficult today to avoid poisoning ourselves with pollution.
If we had another world to use, this strategy might not be quite so dangerous.  We do not.  To travel to another star, we must recycle everything.  Before we dream of interstellar travel, we must learn to recycle everything.  This strategy has the supplemental benefit of keeping our world livable a little longer.
